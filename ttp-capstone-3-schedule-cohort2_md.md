A medium-stakes way to practice your tools so far.

## Schedule
NEW FOR CAPSTONE #3. You **must** perform at least one hypothesis test as part of your presentation. 

The rough process for this is:
* Monday:
    * Explore your data!
    * Think of a questions you could answer with the data
    * Scope your questions/point of view to be answerable by **tomorrow**
* Tuesday:
    * Explore your data sources
    * Think of questions you could answer with the data
    * Scope your questions/point of view to be answerable in a few days
    * MAKE YOUR SLIDES TODAY
* Wednesday at 10 am:
    * Deliver your first draft presentation (4 minutes only)
* Thursday at 10 am:
    * Deliver final presentation (4 minutes only) presentation.


## Learning objectives: What you owe yourself

By the end of the week you should have increased your skill in:
* Obtaining data sources
* Converting your interests + data sources -> a specific question
* Scoping a project to fit within a certain amount of time
  * (No one is good at this)
* Attending daily check-in meetings
* Presenting by yourself on a deadline
* Note: Tableau Dashboards are a nice to have, but not required for Capstone 2!

This is not something we do for you. This is something that you do for yourself, by way of achieving the deliverables.

## Presentation Criteria:
* Your presentation should study the data from a point of view. For example, are you a host, are you a government thinking about adding regulation, are you a business thinking of competing against AirBnB in your target city, etc.

* Produce a 3-4 page presentation, excluding cover page,conclusion page, and an optional, clearly-marked appendix.
* Maximum of 3 graphs per page 
* Maximum ~50 words of text per slide
* Final presentation should take a MAXIMUM of four minutes
* Any final presentations above the max four (4) page limit and any final presentation that doesnâ€™t meet the other criteria listed above will be rejected!!!!!

## Deliverables: What you owe us

* MAKE A NEW DIRECTORY and git repo called `YOURNAME-CAPSTONE3` and subdir called `YOURNAME-CAPSTONE3/DATA` inside .
* Download dataset(s) and Put all the Capstone 3 DATA files in YOURNAME-CAPSTONE3/DATA.
* Examine the csv files. What should the data types of each column be if the CSV were converted into Pandas?
* Upload your CSV files into pandas
* Explore the data! 
   1. Is the data clean?
   1. Are there values/columns that you should drop?
* Output your data from pandas to a csv. 
* Make one simple visualization using seaborn/matpolotlib/Tableau and send the URL to the class channel.
* Make a repo on github and push your files.

  * Continue work on pandas analysis and your visualizations that address your topics of interest for the rest of the day.
  * Come up with a point of view!
  * Finish your visualizations!
  * Do a hypothesis test!
  * Create your slides!

Write about your feelings during the process and more details about your struggle. No one else will see this but you. It is your second Capstone diary entry. Due date: NEVER
  * Write a good `README.md` file in the main directory, based on your diary and your official presentation, that describes what you've done and the technologies you've used to do it. If someone looks at the project, this might be all they see. Make it clear.
